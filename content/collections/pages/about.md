<p><em>Get Outside</em> is a community initiative started by Daryl Chymko designed to inspire and support individuals engaging in human-powered outdoor adventures. Whether embarking on unique and challenging expedition or putting together a local club focused on a single activity, it encourages people of all skill levels to explore the outdoors and promotes a lifestyle rooted in activity, wellness, and connection with nature. Through various forms of assistance, <em>Get Outside</em> supports adventurers by helping them access the resources they need to make their adventures a success, while fostering a community that values the joy and empowerment of outdoor exploration.</p>
