<p>After a rest day, it was time to get back at 'er and did I ever. Today's run went through through Mission Hill and south Alexis Park which amounted to 27km or about 10% of the road system in Vernonr. Starting in the downtown core, I wound my way up winding residential streets to a surprise (!!) path that had amazing 180 views all the way from Silver Star to Terrace Mountain. </p>

<p>This little running project has been a lot of fun and come with all kinds of discoveries. There's so much to discover in each and every one of the neighborhoods here, from parks, corner stores, secret paths, and churches converted into houses. If you have the time, I highly recommend checking out the trail that runs across the top of this area, it starts near the ball diamonds on Mission Road. the views to the south are fantastic.</p>
