<p>This is my mantra as I spend the next (?) days riding the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/bcepic1000/">@bcepic1000</a>&nbsp;route across British Columbia. This is a unsupported adventure with no aid stations, no prizes, no awards, just a bunch of self-powered humans making their way along 1060+km with all our own gear, supplies and "accommodations (aka tent or bivy).</p>

<p>My mantra is a play on the acronym FKT "Fastest Known Time" which is something the endurance world uses to track who has done a route the fastest. Now I'm not (currently) built for speed, so when thinking about my goals for this adventure, i came up with another metric: Fun, taking it all in and cherishing the adventure no matter what happens.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Funnest Known time:</li>
<li>Eat at the greasy spoons</li>
<li>Never turn down an opportunity for ice cream</li>
<li>Stop and talk to the animals</li>
<li>Say yes to the cafes along the way</li>
<li>Pet all the (good) dogs</li>
<li>Never leave an interesting conversation in the interest of time.</li>
<li>Treat unexpected problems (type 2 fun) as an opportunity to slow down rather than rush through.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll post some pics along the way and if your into following dots, I'll post the tracker before we depart Saturday morning.</p>

<p>This wouldn't be possible without the support of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/charsutt/">@charsutt</a>&nbsp;who is also wrangling all the furbabies while I'm out doing this thing.</p>
