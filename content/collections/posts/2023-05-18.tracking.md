<p>"I can do hard things. I can do hard things." This was the mantra I repeated to myself when things got tough along the 380km route that made this year's BC Buckshot. But during the last hour, I found myself saying it out loud continually, willing my battered and beaten body into the finish. In the end, I did the hard thing in just under 37h and I had a great time overall. The course ran through some of the most scenic terrain the Kamloops area has to offer, from the mighty Fraser Valley to the chiselled bluffs of the Deadman river. (Although as scenic as Drinkwater Road near the Fraser is, if I never ever had to ride it again, I'd be 100% okay with that.)</p>

<p>Two highlights for me were first, finding out that after a long first day, The Packinghouse in Spence's Bridge was staying open late for riders. That was the best grilled ham and cheese I've had in my life, Candice, you and your crew were lifesavers!</p>

<p>The second highlight was meeting and riding with so many other riders. It's one of the main reasons I do these things, and I'm grateful for all the conversations and laughs along the way with @myback40_podcast @mlowry06 @char.cycles @meaghanhackinen @glen.buchanan @ultra_black_barbet, and so many more.</p>
