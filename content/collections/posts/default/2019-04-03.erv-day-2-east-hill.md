<p> Tonight’s run was on the roads surrounding Vernon Secondary School. Fun fact: In August 2016, the school was used as a film set for the Vampire-themed movie “Drink, slay, love.” It’s described as:”about a typical 16-year-old vampire named Pearl who is fond of blood, allergic to sunlight and generally pretty evil, until a unicorn stabs her through the heart with his horn.” Typical teenagers!  </p>
