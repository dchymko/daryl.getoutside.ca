<p>They don’t call it “East Hill” ‘cause it’s flat. But, oh those views you get. Not to mention it’s proximity to both downtown and the countryside. Mutrie road along the east has views of the mountains as well as a dog park. And there’s the odd walking path between streets to provide a break from vehicle traffic. Other than that, it’s a purely residential area so unless you live there, there’s not much reason to visit (not that I found anyway.)</p>
