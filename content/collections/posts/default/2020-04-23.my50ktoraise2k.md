<p>Announcement! I'm running my virtual #aravaipastrong 50K race tomorrow in support of the Central Okanagan Foodbank. They have seen a significant increase of requests recently and could really use extra support right now. My goal is to raise over $2000 in just 24h and I'm asking <em>you</em> to help me do it. A not-so-anonymous donor (me) has pledged to match every donation made up to a total of $2000. So this is an opportunity for us to make a really big impact together! I also know that not everyone is in a position to give right now, so I'm also happy to make a donation of $2 for every share, comment, and supportive text along the way. Link to donate is on my profile, and thank you SO MUCH for your support! I will send updates along the way.</p>

<p>The CO Food Bank has seen a 27% increase in requests the past 2 weeks alone, and in that time have helped feed 780 households and 550 children. Every 1$ donated enables the Food Bank to buy $3 of food, so any donation amount helps. In other words, with the matching, your $50 donation enables them to buy $300 of food!</p>

<p>My route will start and end at my house, and will be fully solo and self-supported adventure. It takes me though East Vernon, up the Shuswap Highlands to Becker Lake, down through Lavington, up Bluenose and returning on the backroads of Coldstream</p>

<p>*(I will cap my matched and $2 donations at @1000â€¦. Unless another anonymous donor wants to jump in?! )</p>
